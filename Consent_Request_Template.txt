Subject: Request to include your current Dribbble shots in an academic research dataset

Hi <Creator Name>,

My name is Olayinka Vaughan, a sophomore at Wesleyan University. I’m building a research dataset to study accessible, high-quality web UI patterns for an academic/experimental AI project. I’m writing to request your permission to include ALL of your current Dribbble shots in the dataset.

What we store
- The images you published (no alterations beyond thumbnailing for indexing)
- Basic metadata per shot (title, your handle/profile link, tags)
- Our internal labels describing visible components (e.g., hero, cards, pricing)

How it will be used
- Non-commercial research and model development/evaluation
- May be shared with collaborators under the same non-commercial research terms
- We will attribute you by name and link to your Dribbble profile wherever this sample appears

What we will NOT do
- We will not resell, redistribute, or license your artwork for commercial use
- We will not remove your authorship or claim ownership
- We will remove your work promptly upon request

Your options (please reply with one):
1) I consent to inclusion of ALL my current Dribbble shots for non-commercial research purposes with attribution.
2) I consent with these conditions (edit any that apply):
   - Attribution: Credit as "<Name/Handle>" with link <URL>.
   - Scope exclusions: Exclude these shots: <list or links>.
   - Distribution: Internal research only (no public dataset hosting).
   - Derivatives: Thumbnails OK; no cropping/watermark removal.
   - Duration: Consent valid until <date> (or revoke anytime).
   - Revocation SLA: Remove within <N> business days after request.
3) I do not consent.

If you consent, please also confirm:
- How you would like to be attributed (name/handle/link)
- Whether derivative thumbnails are permitted for indexing (yes/no)
- An email to reach you for any takedown or updates

Attribution example
© <Creator Name> — <Dribbble Profile URL> — used with permission for non‑commercial research.

Takedown
If at any time you’d like us to remove the sample, email <your email>. We will remove it within 5 business days and confirm.

Thank you for considering!

Best,
